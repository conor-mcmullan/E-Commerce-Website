ABOUT US

Driftworks LTD has grown from being run out of a 
tiny spare room in Phil’s house, into a 
multi-million pound business based in self owned 
12,000 sq/ft facility in the UK. 

The Driftworks team and business keeps growing
and we now design and sell some of the most
advanced components for drift and track cars you
can buy off the shelf. We pride ourselves on
exceptional, friendly and knowledgeable customer
service plus lightening fast international 
shipping.

Driftworks suspension parts are used on 
competition winning cars across the world. 
Including the UK, Formula D in the USA and D1 in
Japan.

Our stable includes cars such as 
the world famous Driftworks DW86, a V8 powered
monster AE86 Corolla, various development and
practice cars and the Driftworks 1JZ 560bhp 
Nissan Skyline.
