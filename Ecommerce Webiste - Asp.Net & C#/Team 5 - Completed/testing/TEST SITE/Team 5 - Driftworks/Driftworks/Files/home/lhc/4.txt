DRIFTING INFO

Drifting is a driving style in which the 
driver uses the throttle, brakes, clutch, 
gear shifting and steering input to keep 
the car in a state of oversteer while 
manoeuvring from turn to turn. 

Drifters emphasise car control by 
coordinating the amount of countersteer 
(or opposite lock) with the simultaneous 
modulation of the throttle and brakes to 
shift the weight balance of the car back 
and forth through the turns. 

Furthermore, they strive to achieve this 
while adhering to the standard racing lines 
(or designated “clipping points” if 
drifting in competition) and maintaining 
extreme slip angles.
