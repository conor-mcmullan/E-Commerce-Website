MEET THE TEAM 

The Driftworks Drift team is one of the 
most successful drift teams in Europe, 
headed by company director Phil Morrison,
who has 2 championship titles and a host 
of runner up finishes in professional 
level drift competitions. 

At the very end of it all though, we’re all 
enthusiasts and friends who like to have fun 
in crazy cars. We do this for the love of it, 
and we hope that’s reflected in our business.

If you have any questions, no matter how silly, ask us!
