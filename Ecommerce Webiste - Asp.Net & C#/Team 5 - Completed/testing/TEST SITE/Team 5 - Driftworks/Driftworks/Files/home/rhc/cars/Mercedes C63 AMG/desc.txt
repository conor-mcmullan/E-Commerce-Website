What's it like to drive?

Despite flying two-and-a-half hours south, to the 
Costa del Sol, were greeted by decidedly British weather. 

Its a great shame, for the roads - particularly 
the one that winds through the mountains from 
Marbella to Ronda - are terrific. 

There were fleeting moments when we enjoyed drying 
tarmac, but unfortunately the weather got even 
worse at the Ascari Race Resort.

Sodden conditions are not the best in which to 
unleash a 510bhp coupe, but they do prove you 
can put your faith in the assorted stability systems. 

Im old enough to remember the days when planting 
your right foot in an AMG product on a wet road 
(or a dry one, come to that!) 
would so completely spook the traction control 
that the car would barely move. 

Its fair to say the C63 Coupe remains traction-limited, 
but the ESP is so well-judged you can make extremely 
rapid (and safe) progress, and have fun at the same time.
