The Logins are self explanatory and held in the database

Login in as a user first please 


expected problem - this wasnt the completed iteration 

adding the same product at different times in any qauntity will cause a crash as because of the product id at the checkout stage (stupid to even be doing that so don't worry)


* MUST ! 
change the database loaction in the main config file to where you are storing the database


* further
any problem experienced while using the admin user can and probably be fixed by the F5 key or browser refresh
